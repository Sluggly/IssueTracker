Post bugs or suggestions related in any way to my mods here !

Informations I might need to fix the bug :
- Minecraft version and ModLoader version
- Mod version
- If you play on Singleplayer, Online Server or local LAN.

A crash log is preferable if available but you can also describe what you were doing. If the log is long you can use Pastebin.com and send the link.

Thanks a lot for reading !
